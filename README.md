## Project Idea

In our lab experiments we used a lot of Libraries from the mbed community. We wanted contribute back to them and hone our C++ skills. 

We narrowed down on the SparkFun Qwiic ENS160 Air Quality Sensor as it was very recently launched and would be significantly challenging to write a C++ based I2C driver for mbed board.

We also planned on extending our driver to Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Raspberry Pi Pico. We worked on the Pi Pico driver but faced multiple issues trying to debug it.
